# Copilot Instructions

This project's AI instructions live in the root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) — the single source of
truth for all agents. Read it first, along with [.github/PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md)
(current architecture and state). Search [.github/KNOWLEDGE.md](KNOWLEDGE.md) (solutions,
patterns, gotchas) for the area you are working on — don't read it whole.

Modern Copilot surfaces (VS Code agent mode, Copilot CLI, coding agent, code review) read
`AGENTS.md` natively — this file exists only for older surfaces that read
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` first, and to avoid ambiguity: it is a pointer, not duplicated
content. Do not add rules here; add them to `AGENTS.md`.
